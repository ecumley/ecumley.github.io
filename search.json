    "text": "Tebowing and Tebowmania took the NFL world by storm in 2011 when the Denver Broncos somehow snuck into the playoffs by winning their division with an 8-8 record. In case you don’t remember, Tebowing is when Tim Tebow would drop to one knee on the field, his head bowed meeting his fist and pray. \nIt always seemed like the Broncos were a prayer away from victory. Maybe, that’s because in most cases they were. 13 of their 18 games they either won or lost by less than a touchdown, if we include the playoff game against the 12-4 Pittsburgh Steelers and the New England Patriots. That must have been a stressful season for a Broncos fan. But, were all these narrowly decided games luck, skill, or the source of a higher power? \nThe Broncos made the playoffs because they won their division. Hence why they were able to play a home playoff game against the Steelers. Looking at the other eight teams that finished 8-8 or 9-7 but did not make the playoffs, how did Denver match up? We’ll also look at the Steelers who the Broncos beat in the first round of the playoffs. Just to have a baseline of what a playoff team’s stats look like. \nGranted the Broncos are in the AFC so an NFC team who finished 8-8 is not eligible to make the playoffs in the AFC. But, what’s the harm in looking? \n\nSurely a division winner should get to be in the playoffs, but did they deserve it? To measure how good a team is we can look at their offense and defense as a whole. One way to do this is with the turnover margin. \n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(wehoop)\n\nstats &lt;- read_csv(\"2011BroncosStatSheet.csv\")\n\nbroncos &lt;- stats |&gt; filter(Team == \"Denver Broncos\")\nsteelers &lt;- stats |&gt; filter(Team== \"Pittsburgh Steelers\")\n\neightsbar &lt;- stats |&gt;\n  filter(Record == \"8-8\" | Record == \"9-7\") |&gt;\n  filter(Playoffs == \"N\")|&gt;\n  group_by(Team)\n\ntables &lt;- bind_rows(broncos, steelers, eightsbar)\n\ntable &lt;- tables |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    turnovermargin = Takeaways - TO\n  )\n\ntable |&gt; \n  select(Team, TO, Takeaways, turnovermargin)|&gt;\n  arrange(desc(turnovermargin)) |&gt; \n  gt() |&gt; \n  cols_label(\n    TO = \"Turnovers\",\n    Takeaways = \"Takeaways\",\n    turnovermargin = \"Turnover Margin\",\n    theme_minimal()\n  )|&gt;\ntab_header(\n    title = \"Total turnovers, total takeaways, and turnover margin\",\n    subtitle = \"Did the Broncos have the worst turnover margin?\"\n  ) |&gt; \n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color=\"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  )|&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n  )|&gt; \n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"**By:** Erik Cumley  |  **Source:** Sports Football Reference\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n     locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n     style = list(\n       cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(3)),\n       cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size=15)\n     )\n   ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"#FB4F14\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"navy\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = Team == \"Denver Broncos\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"black\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"gold\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = Team == \"Pittsburgh Steelers\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal turnovers, total takeaways, and turnover margin\n\n\nDid the Broncos have the worst turnover margin?\n\n\nTeam\nTurnovers\nTakeaways\nTurnover Margin\n\n\n\n\nDallas Cowboys\n21\n25\n4\n\n\nChicago Bears\n29\n31\n2\n\n\nTennessee Titans\n22\n23\n1\n\n\nNew York Jets\n34\n31\n-3\n\n\nOakland Raiders\n30\n26\n-4\n\n\nSan Diego Chargers\n28\n21\n-7\n\n\nDenver Broncos\n30\n18\n-12\n\n\nPittsburgh Steelers\n28\n15\n-13\n\n\nArizona Cardinals\n32\n19\n-13\n\n\nPhiladelphia Eagles\n38\n24\n-14\n\n\n\nBy: Erik Cumley | Source: Sports Football Reference\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Broncos finished with the fourth worst turnover margin of the teams. But, wait they’re above the Steelers! That’s a playoff team, thus the Broncos deserved to make the playoffs right? Well not quite, that season the Steelers finished with the No. 1 defense in the NFL. If your defense is ranked No. 1 in the entire NFL it’s okay that your turnover margin isn’t the greatest. \nThe other two teams the Broncos are ahead of were two NFC teams. Of the AFC teams the Broncos had the worst turnover margin, and it’s not very close. Two of the teams ahead of the Broncos are even in their division. At the time the San Diego Chargers and Oakland Raiders both had much better turnover margins than Denver. \nTurnovers and takeaways may influence the game but what wins games? Points! Scoring wins games. Score more than your opponent and you win regardless of turnovers, penalties, rushing yards, passing yards, etc. Maybe the Broncos just had ridiculous points for and points against.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\n\nstats &lt;- read_csv(\"2011BroncosStatSheet.csv\")\n\nbroncos &lt;- stats |&gt; filter(Team == \"Denver Broncos\")\nsteelers &lt;- stats |&gt; filter(Team== \"Pittsburgh Steelers\")\n\neights &lt;- stats |&gt;\n  filter(Record == \"8-8\" | Record == \"9-7\") |&gt;\n  filter(Playoffs == \"N\")|&gt;\n  group_by(Team)\n\neightsdumb &lt;- bind_rows(broncos, steelers, eights)\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data=eightsdumb, \n    aes(y=reorder(Team, PtsFor), x=PtsFor, xend=PtsAllowed),\n    size = 1.5,\n    colour = \"grey\",\n    colour_x = \"green\",\n    colour_xend = \"red\")+\n   labs(\n    title=\"Points for and points against\", \n    subtitle = \"If &lt;span style = 'color:green;'&gt;Points For&lt;/span&gt; are on the right, that's good.

The green dots represent how many points for the team while the red dots represent how many points went against the team. In total Denver finished with 309 total points and 390 points were scored against them. Not only did they get scored on the second most of the other teams, they also finished last in points for! And the No. 1 defense Steelers just didn’t allow anyone to score. Meanwhile, the Chargers sit atop with 406 points for and 377 points against. It’s clear the efficiency of scoring was not there.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nstats &lt;- read_csv(\"2011BroncosStatSheet.csv\")\n\neightsbar &lt;- stats |&gt;\n  filter(Record == \"8-8\" | Record == \"9-7\") |&gt;\n  filter(Playoffs == \"N\")|&gt;\n  group_by(Team)\n\nbroncos &lt;- stats |&gt; filter(Team == \"Denver Broncos\")\nsteelers &lt;- stats |&gt; filter(Team== \"Pittsburgh Steelers\")\n\nbar &lt;- bind_rows(eightsbar, broncos, steelers)\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data = bar, aes(x=reorder(Team, PctEndScore), weight=PctEndScore), fill=\"lightgray\")+\n  geom_bar(data=broncos, aes(x=Team, weight=PctEndScore), fill=\"#FB4F14\")+\n  geom_bar(data = steelers, aes(x=Team, weight=PctEndScore), fill = \"#FFB612\")+\n  coord_flip()+\n  labs(\n    x=\"\",\n    y=\"Percentage each drive end in score\",\n    title = \"Percentage each offensive drive to end in points\",\n    subtitle = \"The Broncos had the lowest percentage to score on each offensive possession\",\n    caption=\"Source: Sports Football Reference | By: Erik Cumley\"\n  )+\n  theme_minimal()+\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA whopping 24.5% chance to finish their offensive drives with points. Not touchdowns, just getting points on the board. Each time the Broncos had an offensive possession they had a less than 25% chance of scoring points. Of the other AFC teams all but the Jets had over a 30% chance to score, the Jets sit at 29.6%. Once again the Chargers sit atop with 41.3%. \nHow did the 8-8 Broncos not just make the playoffs but defeat a far superior opponent in the Steelers. Denver found its miracle in Tim Tebow who swept the nation. One of the wildest roller coaster seasons would never make a return as the next season Tebow was traded to the New York Jets for a fourth and sixth round pick. \nLooking back on the season it very well could have been the most stressful season in Broncos history. Despite the inefficient offense and the atrocious defense somehow they made the playoffs. With a lot of luck, some skill, and a dash of prayer the Denver Broncos got the job done."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Obviously there was some push back, criticism, and disagreement with the NFL’s decision to make Lamar Jackson the 2023 Most Valuable Player. NFL fans would say it wasn’t deserved or other players such as Dak Prescott or Brock Purdy should have gotten the award. We can look at the stats from the other deserving players from the 2023 season all we want. But, what about the previous MVP’s?\nHow does Lamar Jackson’s 2023 MVP season stack up against the last 10 years of MVP winners. Luckily the NFL has basically made the MVP award a quarterback award so the last 10 MVP winners have been quarterbacks.\nQuarterback play is one of if not the most important position on the field. That being said, an MVP should have a fantastic QBR right? Look at that Lamar Jackson had the highest QBR of the 10 other MVP’s, in his 2019 MVP season. If we look at his 2023 season it’s nowhere near as good.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nmvp &lt;- read_csv(\"mvpdata.csv\") |&gt; mutate(PlayerSeason = paste(Name, Year))\n\nlj &lt;- mvp |&gt; filter(Year == \"2023\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=mvp, aes(x=reorder(PlayerSeason, QBR), weight=QBR)) +\n  geom_bar(data=lj, aes(x=reorder(PlayerSeason, QBR), weight=QBR), fill=\"purple\")+\n  coord_flip()+\n  labs(\n    x=\"\",\n    y=\"QBR\",\n    title = \"Lamar's quarterback ratings falls short of a typcial MVP\",\n    subtitle = \"Efficency is key for super bowl teams\",\n    caption=\"Source: Sports Football Reference | By: Erik Cumley\"\n  )+\n  theme_minimal()+\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond to last, just above Cam Newton’s 2015 season. That would make sense because they’re both considered running quarterbacks right. Wrong, Lamar Jackson had 821 total rushing yards, with 5.5 yards per attempt in 2023. Since 2019 Jacksons rushing yards per game have consistently gone down.\nMeaning he is running less each year, naturally you’d think his QBR would then go up. You’d also maybe think that since he’s running less his passing touchdowns and passing yards would get better. Again, false you see that little purple dot. Those are passing touchdowns, the table on the right says the lowest is 25. He only threw 24 touchdowns in 2023. Jackson rushed for five touchdowns in 2023 so even if we include total touchdowns his dot is still the smallest.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\nMVP &lt;- read_csv(\"mvpdata.csv\") |&gt; mutate(PlayerSeason = paste(Name, Year))\n\nlj &lt;- MVP |&gt; filter(PlayerSeason == \"Lamar Jackson 2023\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(\n    data=MVP, aes(x=Int, y=Yards, size=TD), color=\"black\", alpha=.3) + \n  geom_point(\n    data=lj, aes(x=Int, y=Yards, size=TD), color=\"purple\") +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 7.818182) + \n  geom_hline(yintercept = 4434.727  ) +\n   geom_text_repel(\n    data=MVP, \n    aes(x=Int, y=Yards, label=PlayerSeason)\n  )+\n  scale_size_continuous(name=\"Touchdowns\") +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Interceptions\",\n    y=\"Passing Yards\",\n    title = \"2023's MVP threw for less touchdowns than any previous MVP's\",\n    subtitle = \"Size matters, bigger circles means more touchdowns\",\n    caption=\"Source: Sports Football Reference | By: Erik Cumley\"\n  )+\n  theme_minimal()+\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow can a player only have 24 passing touchdowns and still win the MVP?

This time Jackson takes the second to last and last in passing yards per game. In his most recent MVP season he was not clutch in the fourth quarter or in game winning drives. Even Cam Newton’s 2015 season was more clutch. It’s also common for the MVP of that season to make the Super Bowl. Every other MVP on this list has at least made it to the Super Bowl.\nIn the end this was easily the worst MVP season the NFL has given to anyone in recent years. Lamar Jackson had the worst QBR, least amount of touchdowns, and wasn’t clutch. The MVP award is supposed to be the Most Valuable Player in the NFL. Jackson’s 2023 MVP season was the least valuable of the last 10 MVP winners."
